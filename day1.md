**A 20DaysOfMinecraftServer** challenge is a guide for both beginners and advanced Server developers.me to ServerDeveloping. ServerDeveloping is very easy. I enjoy using and teaching ServerDeveloping and I hope you will do so too.


## Requirements

No prior knowledge of programming is required to follow this. You need only:
1. Motivation
2. A computer
3. Internet
4. A browser
5. A Hosting

## Hosting

There are two ways you can host your Server
1. On Your own Computer/VPS etc
2. Online on a Minecraft Server hosting website

### The First Method(On your own Computer/pc)

This is not the best option for you, For some reasons-Note
1. You Need a Computer/Pc for it
2. It atleast have 8GB ram
3. If you ShutDown your Computer/Pc the server will also shutdown 
4. You need a Domain for it also
5. If have lower ram then can't play or do something while server is online
6. Require High Speed Internet Also

### The Second Method(On a Hosting Website)

This is best way, You dont need anything in this. If you have some money then can buy a good server host or other wise can use free host
Some of them are-
1. [Aternos](https://aternos.org/)- Good for them who are begginers
2. [Falix](https://falixnodes.net/)- Good For Pro Developers

**Note** Dont use falix if you dont know nothing about Server Developing becuse there are many option you can get confused After learning you can use.
